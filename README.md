# ForestQuery: Global Deforestation Analysis Report (1990-2016)

## Overview

ForestQuery is dedicated to combating deforestation worldwide and raising awareness about its environmental impact. In pursuit of this mission, the data analysis team at ForestQuery has conducted a comprehensive analysis of deforestation trends using data sourced from the World Bank. This report summarizes the findings of ForestQuery's SQL-based analysis, focusing on forest area, total land area by country and year from 1990 to 2016, and the regional distribution of countries.

## Data Sources

The data utilized in this analysis is sourced from the World Bank and includes:

- Forest area and total land area by country and year from 1990 to 2016.
- A table of countries and their respective regions.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of ForestQuery's analysis are:

- To identify regions and countries experiencing significant deforestation.
- To pinpoint areas of concern and potential environmental threats.
- To highlight successful conservation efforts and areas for learning and replication.

## Analysis Methodology

ForestQuery's data analysis team utilized SQL to integrate and query the provided datasets. Key queries focused on:

1. **Total Forest Area and Land Area by Country and Year**: Calculating the change in forest area over time and its proportion relative to the total land area.
   
2. **Regional Deforestation Trends**: Analyzing deforestation trends at the regional level to identify hotspots and areas of conservation success.
   
3. **Comparison of Deforestation Rates**: Comparing deforestation rates between countries and regions to assess variations and patterns.

## Key Findings

Based on the analysis conducted by ForestQuery, the following key findings have emerged:

1. **Global Decline in Forest Cover**: There has been a noticeable decline in global forest cover from 1990 to 2016, with several regions experiencing significant deforestation.

2. **Regional Disparities**: Deforestation rates vary significantly between regions, with some regions showing alarming rates of forest loss while others have managed to maintain or increase forest cover.

3. **Opportunities for Conservation**: Despite the overall decline in forest cover, there are instances of successful conservation efforts and opportunities for replication and learning.

## Next Steps

Moving forward, ForestQuery plans to:

- Further analyze the underlying drivers of deforestation in regions of concern.
- Collaborate with local and international stakeholders to implement targeted conservation strategies.
- Continue monitoring and updating the analysis to track progress and identify emerging trends.
