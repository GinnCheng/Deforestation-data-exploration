Report for ForestQuery into Global Deforestation, 1990 to 2016 
ForestQuery is on a mission to combat deforestation around the world and to raise awareness about this topic and its impact on the environment. The data analysis team at ForestQuery has obtained data from the World Bank that includes forest area and total land area by country and year from 1990 to 2016, as well as a table of countries and the regions to which they belong.

The data analysis team has used SQL to bring these tables together and to query them in an effort to find areas of concern as well as areas that present an opportunity to learn from successes.

1. GLOBAL SITUATION
According to the World Bank, the total forest area of the world was 82016472 sqm in 1990. As of 2016, the most recent year for which data was available, that number had fallen to 79825434 sqm, a loss of 2191038 sqm, or 2.671%.

The forest area lost over this time period is slightly more than the entire land area of 2149681 sqkm listed for the year 2016 (which is Saudi Arabia ).

2. REGIONAL OUTLOOK
In 2016, the percent of the total land area of the world designated as forest was 31.358 %. The region with the highest relative forestation was Latin America & Caribbean, with 46.18%, and the region with the lowest relative forestation was Middle East & North Africa, with 2.07% forestation.

In 1990, the percent of the total land area of the world designated as forest was 32.225%. The region with the highest relative forestation was Latin America & Caribbean, with 51.05%, and the region with the lowest relative forestation was Middle East & North Africa, with 1.78% forestation.







Table 2.1: Percent Forest Area by Region, 1990 & 2016:

Region	1990 Forest Percentage (%)	2016 Forest Percentage (%)
East Asia & Pacific	25.58	26.3
Europe & Central Asia	37.3	38.06
Latin America & Caribbean	51.05	46.18
Middle East & North Africa	1.78	2.07
North America	35.67	36.05
South Asia	16.52	17.51
Sub-Saharan Africa	30.67	28.74
World	32.44	31.39


The only regions of the world that decreased in percent forest area from 1990 to 2016 were  Latin America & Caribbean (dropped from 51.05% to 46.18%) and Sub-Saharan Africa (30.67% to 28.74%). All other regions actually increased in forest area over this time period. However, the drop in forest area in the two aforementioned regions was so large, the percent forest area of the world decreased over this time period from 32.44% to 31.39%. 

3. COUNTRY-LEVEL DETAIL
A.	SUCCESS STORIES
There is one particularly bright spot in the data at the country level, China. This country actually increased in forest area from 1990 to 2016 by 527229.06 sqkm. It would be interesting to study what has changed in this country over this time to drive this figure in the data higher. The country with the next largest increase in forest area from 1990 to 2016 was the United States, but it only saw an increase of 79200 sqkm, much lower than the figure for China.

The United States and China are of course very large countries in total land area, so when we look at the largest percent change in forest area from 1990 to 2016, we aren’t surprised to find a much smaller country listed at the top. French Polynesia increased in forest area by 27.34% from 1990 to 2016. 

B.	LARGEST CONCERNS
Which countries are seeing deforestation to the largest degree? We can answer this question in two ways. First, we can look at the absolute square kilometer decrease in forest area from 1990 to 2016. The following 3 countries had the largest decrease in forest area over the time period under consideration:

Table 3.1: Top 5 Amount Decrease in Forest Area by Country, 1990 & 2016:

Country	Region	Absolute Forest Area Change
Brazil	Latin America & Caribbean	-541510
Indonesia	East Asia & Pacific	-282193.98
Myanmar	East Asia & Pacific	-107234
Nigeria	Sub-Saharan Africa	-106506
Tanzania	Sub-Saharan Africa	-102320


The second way to consider which countries are of concern is to analyze the data by percent decrease.

Table 3.2: Top 5 Percent Decrease in Forest Area by Country, 1990 & 2016:

Country	Region	Pct Forest Area Change
Togo	Sub-Saharan Africa	-75.45
Nigeria	Sub-Saharan Africa	-61.8
Uganda	Sub-Saharan Africa	-59.13
Mauritania	Sub-Saharan Africa	-46.75
Honduras	Latin America & Caribbean	-45.03


When we consider countries that decreased in forest area percentage the most between 1990 and 2016, we find that four of the top 5 countries on the list are in the region of Sub-Saharan Africa. The countries are Togo, Nigeria, Uganda, and Mauritania. The 5th country on the list is Latin America & Caribbean, which is in the Honduras region. 

From the above analysis, we see that Nigeria is the only country that ranks in the top 5 both in terms of absolute square kilometer decrease in forest as well as percent decrease in forest area from 1990 to 2016. Therefore, this country has a significant opportunity ahead to stop the decline and hopefully spearhead remedial efforts.

C.	QUARTILES

Table 3.3: Count of Countries Grouped by Forestation Percent Quartiles, 2016:

Quartile	Number of Countries
1st quartile	52
2nd quartile	51
3rd quartile	51
4th quartile	51

The largest number of countries in 2016 were found in the 1st quartile.

There were 52 countries in the top quartile in 2016. These are countries with a very high percentage of their land area designated as forest. The following is a list of countries and their respective forest land, denoted as a percentage.

Table 3.4: Top Quartile Countries, 2016:
 
Country	Region	Pct Designated as Forest
Suriname	Latin America & Caribbean	98.3
Micronesia, Fed. Sts.	East Asia & Pacific	91.9
Gabon	Sub-Saharan Africa	90.08

4. RECOMMENDATIONS
Write out a set of recommendations as an analyst on the ForestQuery team. 
●	What have you learned from the World Bank data? – The world forestation percentage is decreasing from 1990 to 2016, the worst areas focus on Latin America & Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa
●	Which countries should we focus on over others? – Considering the worst deforestation in percentage, countries like Togo, Nigeria, Uganda, Mauritania should be focused, whilst Brazil and Indonesia also need support as the deforestation area in them is considerable.
